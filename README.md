# Room-Selector
Programs to solve the assignment problem for student houses

These programs finds the fairest assignment of rooms to students in a shared house. 
Each student ranks the rooms 1st to last. The programs take these data and gives possible assignments which have the smallest rank total over all the rooms. 

sometimes there are different combinations of rooms which have ths same rank total. 
in these cases one of the best combinations should then be randomly selected. 

RoomSelector1 uses brute force and checks all the possible room combinations and allows for multiple best combinations
RoomSelector2 is much easier to edit but only provides one possible path which would depend on the order you input the data.
