Todo

find a way to condense the nested for loops in RoomSelector1
find a way for scipy.optimise linear sum assignment to give all results
maybe add a function to input the data instead of editing the source file

all of this is really unnecessary as the code works and only needs to be used once. 
Further edits is bascially wasted time
